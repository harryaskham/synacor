#+TITLE: Synacor Challenge

Solution to the [[https://challenge.synacor.com/][Synacor Challenge]]

~synacor.cabal~ is the source of truth, with Nix deriving everything from here.

* Running
- To run with Cabal, ~cabal run synacor~
- To run with Nix manually, ~cabal2nix . > default.nix && nix-build release.nix && result/bin/synacor~
- To run with Nix automatically, ~cabal --enable-nix run synacor~
- For GHCi, ~cabal v2-repl~ or ~cabal --enable-nix v2-repl~

* Testing
- ~cabal test~ will run the contents of ~test/TestSuite.hs~
- Running with nix manually above will run both the tests and the project, by default

* Adding New Modules
- For every new module added, ~synacor.cabal~ needs updating.
- We also need to run ~gen-hie . > hie.yaml~ for HLS to pick the new modules up.
